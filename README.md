# Suggestions & Bug Reports

This repository is used by the AutoPlus community to submit suggestions, feature requests, and bug reports, as well as to discuss existing ideas.
Please use the provided issue templates when opening an issue. This helps us triage and respond faster.

## Before opening an issue
* Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
* Check pinned or labeled issues to see if your request is already planned or under discussion.

## Choosing the right template
When creating an issue, select the template that best fits your goal:

* **Bug report**
  Use this if something is broken or behaving incorrectly. Include steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, logs, and relevant versions.
* **Suggestion / Feature request**
  Use this to propose a new feature or improvement. Clearly explain where it applies and why it would be useful.
  
If you are unsure which template to use, pick the closest match. Maintainers can relabel or move it during triage.

## Writing a good issue
Clear and focused issues are much easier to act on. Please keep the following in mind:

* **Title**
  Short and specific. For example: "Make the bot send recovery tokens via DM"
* **Description**
  A brief summary of the issue or request in one or two sentences.
* **Steps to reproduce (for bugs)**
  Describe what you did, including exact commands, buttons clicked, or inputs used. Provide test data or a minimal reproduction if possible.
* **Expected vs actual behavior**
  Explain what you expected to happen and what happened instead.
* **Screenshots**
  Attach images directly to the GitHub issue instead of using external image hosts.
* **Impact**
  Let us know whether this blocks usage, is important, or is just a nice-to-have improvement.

Example bug title:
* "Placing a blackjack bet equal to your balance shows `You don't have any points`"

Example feature title:
* "Add filter options to the /history command"

### What to avoid
* Vague titles like "It doesn't work"
* Large one-paragraph reports without steps, examples, or context

## What happens after you open an issue
* A maintainer will review the issue, add labels, and confirm whether it can be reproduced.
* We may ask for additional details, logs, or a minimal reproduction.
* Feature requests may require clarification around priority or use cases.
* If maintainers are split on a suggestion, it may remain open for community discussion before a decision is made.

## Contributing
This repository is focused on reporting and discussing suggestions and bugs. Even if you do not have anything new to submit, you can still help by reviewing existing issues and sharing your feedback or use cases.
Thanks for helping improve AutoPlus!
